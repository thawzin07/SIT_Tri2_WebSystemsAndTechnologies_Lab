        <p>The article element represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application,
            or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication.</p>
        <p>When article elements are nested, the inner article elements represent articles that are in principle related
            to the contents of the outer article.</p>
        <p>Author information associated with an article element does not apply to nested article elements.</p>
